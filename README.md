# Course-Monitor Legacy

Old version of the good old tampermonkey/greasemonkey script if you preferred it this way.


Checks periodically for openings in a user-specified course. 

### Instructions for Use

1. Install greasemonkey/tampermonkey
 
2. Copy paste this script into greasemonkey/tampermonkey: <https://github.com/MarshesDuck/Course-Monitor/blob/master/Course%20Monitor.js>
 
3. Change the course subject and number to the course that you would like to monitor- listed under USER SETTINGS in the script
 
4. Run the script on this page: <https://studentservices.uwo.ca/secure/timetables/mastertt/ttindex.cfm>

5. Allow the webpage to show notifications when prompted. 
 
6. (If your browser has silent notifications)
Make sure that the above website is also given permission to play audio.
