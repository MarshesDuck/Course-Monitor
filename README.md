Credit goes to [@Dryader](https://github.com/Dryader) for the quality of life update. Thank you for pointing out to me that the script would still work if you just directly selected the courses on the course calendar page. 


### July 09 2021 Update:
Now easier to use. User can use the drop down menus on the course calendar site to directly choose their course, instead of modifying code.
If the user prefers to select a course by modifying the code, the legacy code is at <https://github.com/MarshesDuck/CourseMon/tree/Legacy>

### October 16 2020 Update: 
The code still works.
